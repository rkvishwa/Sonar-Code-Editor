## 📖 Overview

**Sonar Code Editor** is a feature-rich desktop IDE built with Electron, React, and Vite. It leverages the robust Monaco Editor for a VS Code-like coding experience and integrates real-time collaboration using Yjs and WebSockets. Beyond standard editing, Sonar includes an administrative monitoring system, activity logging, and report generation, making it ideal for supervised coding environments, pair programming, and educational settings.

## ✨ Key Features

- **💡 Advanced Code Editing**
  - Powered by **Monaco Editor** (the engine behind VS Code).
  - Syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code formatting.
  - **Custom Tabs** for managing multiple open documents seamlessly.

- **🤝 Real-time Collaboration**
  - Seamless, Google Docs-style real-time typing using **Yjs** and **y-monaco**.
  - Collaborative cursors and shared document states.

- **🛡️ Administration & User Capabilities**
  - **Admin Abilities**: Built-in Admin Dashboard to manage environment settings, monitor real-time user activities, and govern access.
  - **User Abilities**: Dedicated coding environment with secure login, file management, and real-time collaboration.
  - Detailed **Activity Logging** tracking user actions and events.
  - Generates comprehensive PDF reports via **jsPDF**.
  - **File Tree Key Shield** functionality to control access and secure environments.

- **📁 Interactive Workspace**
  - **Custom File Tree** visual explorer for localized workspace navigation.
  - Resizable panels (Editor, Preview, Sidebar) via `react-resizable-panels`.

- **🌐 Secure Preview Panel**
  - Integrated **Preview Panel & Preview Tab** to view live runtime environments.
  - Built-in security restriction: the preview can only load `localhost` URLs on any port (defaults to port `5173`), preventing arbitrary external browsing inside the IDE.

- **🔐 Cloud & Authentication**
  - Integrated **Appwrite** backend for secure authentication, database, and real-time events.
  - Robust offline support and network connectivity tracking (`is-online`).
